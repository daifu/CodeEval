# Little Bob loves chocolates and goes to the store with a $N bill with $C being the price of each chocolate. In addition, the store offers a discount: for every M wrappers he gives the store, heâ€™ll get one chocolate for free. How many chocolates does Bob get to eat?
#
# Input Format:
# The first line contains the number of test cases T (<=1000).
# Each of the next T lines contains three integers N, C and M
#
# Output Format:
# Print the total number of chocolates Bob eats.
