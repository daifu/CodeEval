Commuting Engineer

Challenge Description:

We spend a lot of time and money commuting. As well as many times we
need to stop by at several places in the City. Let's stop commuting and
live in San Francisco!

Solving the following challenge means finding the shortest possible
route which visits each coordinate once starting from the point 1. You

On the map you can see the best route for 5 coordinates. But we've added
5 more. So you need to find the best route for 10 coordinates.
